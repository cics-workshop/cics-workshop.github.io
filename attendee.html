    <h4>Expected behavior</h4>
    <p>
        All participants in the CI/CS Workshop and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.
        All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a
        positive and professional learning environment, we encourage the following kinds of behaviors in all workshop
        events and platforms:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use welcoming and inclusive language</li>
        <li>Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences</li>
        <li>Gracefully accept constructive criticism</li>
        <li>Focus on what is best for the community</li>
        <li>Show courtesy and respect towards other community members</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Unacceptable behavior</h4>
    <p>
        Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants at any workshop event/platform include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any
            specific group
        </li>
        <li>causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation</li>
        <li>violent threats or language directed against another person</li>
        <li>the display of sexual or violent images</li>
        <li>unwelcome sexual attention</li>
        <li>nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact</li>
        <li>sustained disruption of talks, events, or communications</li>
        <li>insults or put downs</li>

        <li>excessive swearing</li>
        <li>incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm</li>
        <li>continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to
            stop
        </li>
        <li>publication of private communication without consent</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Consequences of Unacceptable behavior</h4>
    <p>
        If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it to any of the workshop
        organizers. Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. If
        a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the organizers may warn the offender, ask
        them to leave the event or platform, or investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate
        sanctions.
